Title: Homework 1

Description:

	Using Node Sampling and Edge Sampling traceback algorithms on a simulated network.

To compile and run:

	$ g++ hm1.cpp -o test
	$ ./test

Info:

	The other txt files represent different graphs and output. All are named accordingly.
	The program will output to terminal and to a output file called output.txt.

	The structure of the graphs in the txt files is:

		Router's IP		|	Next Router's IP	|	Type of Router

Note:

	The output file is appended to, so it would be best to delete it if you want new data.
